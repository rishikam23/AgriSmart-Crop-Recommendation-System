# AgriSmart Crop Recommendation

AgriSmart is an intelligent crop recommendation system designed to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on soil and environmental conditions. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze parameters such as soil nutrients, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall to provide accurate crop suggestions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts the best crop to grow based on:
  - Soil nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
  - pH level
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Rainfall
- Machine learning-based predictive model
- Easy-to-use interface (CLI / Web / Mobile compatible)
- Scalable and customizable for various regions and datasets
- Future support for dynamic weather API integration

## 🧠 Model Details

- The system is built using supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, or SVM).
- Trained on agricultural datasets containing soil and environmental parameters with corresponding suitable crops.
- The model can be retrained with regional data for improved accuracy.

---

## 📝 Usage

Once the app is running:

- Enter soil nutrient values (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
- The system will output the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integration with live weather APIs
- Mobile app support
- Geo-location based crop suggestions
- Multi-language support for farmers in different regions
